# Optimally oriented flux

This is a Python reimplementation of the MATLAB code by [Max W.K. Law](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/3828171): [Optimally Oriented Flux (OOF) for 3D Curvilinear Structure Detection](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/41612-optimally-oriented-flux-oof-for-3d-curvilinear-structure-detection).

I haven't verified that it works exactly the same.

## Installation

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/fepegar/optimally-oriented-flux
```

## Usage

```shell
oof input_file.nii.gz output_file.nii.gz
```
